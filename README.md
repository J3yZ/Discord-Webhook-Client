## About  
This project is simply a very minimalistic wrapper over the Discord Webhook API. The intention is not to cache anything and to make this webhook client as minimalistic as possible. It is written in TypeScript for included typings.

## Installation  
    You are expected to have a reasonably up-to-date Node.js version. The library is only testing on the LTS version of Node.js as of this date (currently Node v14).

Install using NPM
```
npm install discord-webhook-client
```
